# 7 Stages of LLM Fine-Tuning

This repository contains an interactive guide to the seven stages of Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, providing a practical roadmap from data preparation to model monitoring in production.

## Overview

Fine-tuning LLMs transforms raw potentials into specialized powers. Each stage builds upon the last, ensuring your models are not just intelligent, but precisely aligned with your unique needs.

## The 7 Stages

### 1. üßπ Data Preparation
Collect, clean, and structure high-quality datasets tailored to your model's objectives. Ensure diversity, balance, and relevance for optimal performance.

**Key Tasks:**
- Identify and source appropriate datasets: public repositories (Hugging Face, Kaggle), generate synthetic data, or collect private datasets under compliance
- Implement rigorous cleaning: remove duplicates, handle outliers, perform quality assurance checks, and scrub personally identifiable information (PII)
- Tokenization and normalization: Convert text to tokens using model-compatible tokenizers, handle special cases like multilingual text or code
- Advanced formatting: Structure data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as JSONL, for preference optimization (DPO/ORPO) as pairwise comparisons
- Strategic splitting: Use stratified sampling to ensure train/validation/test sets represent the full data distribution

**Tools:** pandas, NumPy, spaCy, NLTK, Cleanlab, Datasets (ü§ó), Refuel/Refinery, Label Studio, DVC, Great Expectations

### 2. üß† Model Initialization
Select and configure the foundational model architecture. Evaluate licenses, memory constraints, and tokenizer compatibility for seamless integration.

**Key Tasks:**
- Select a pretrained model: Match size (7B, 13B) and capabilities to task domain (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral, GPT-J)
- Implement quantization: Apply 4-bit or 8-bit quantization using bitsandbytes to reduce VRAM usage without significant quality loss
- Configure tokenizer: Load compatible tokenizer, add custom special tokens if needed, and set freezing parameters for fine-tuning specific layers

**Tools:** PyTorch, Transformers (ü§ó), TensorFlow, ONNX, bitsandbytes, Torch Hub

### 3. ‚öôÔ∏è Training Setup
Configure environment, accelerators, and hyperparameters.

**Key Tasks:**
- Pick strategy: full FT, adapters (LoRA), PEFT, or instruction-tuning
- Initialize optimizer & scheduler; choose loss (SFT, DPO, SFT+RLHF)
- Distributed training (DDP/DeepSpeed/FSDP); mixed precision

**Tools:** PyTorch Lightning, Accelerate, DeepSpeed, FSDP, Torch.compile, Weights & Biases

### 4. üéØ Fine-Tuning
Run the training loop with checkpoints & logging.

**Key Tasks:**
- Standard SFT on curated instruction data
- Parameter-Efficient FT (LoRA, QLoRA, adapters)
- Domain/task-specific FT with curriculum or mixed sampling
- Checkpointing, gradient accumulation, early stopping

**Tools:** Transformers Trainer, TRL (DPO/ORPO/RLHF), PEFT, DeepSpeed, Optuna (search), W&B (logging)

### 5. üß™ Validation & Evaluation
Measure quality, robustness, and safety; tune hyperparameters.

**Key Tasks:**
- Compute loss/accuracy and track learning curves
- Evaluate with task metrics (BLEU/ROUGE/exact-match), preference models
- Analyze harmful outputs, hallucinations, bias; adversarial prompts
- Overfitting checks, noisy gradient detection

**Tools:** mlflow, Weights & Biases, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Eleuther Eval Harness, HELM/G-Eval

### 6. üöÄ Deployment
Package and serve the model with performance & safety in mind.

**Key Tasks:**
- Choose endpoint: serverless, GPU VM, or on-prem
- Compile/optimize (TensorRT, vLLM); quantize for latency
- Add rate limiting, safety filters, observability, A/B flags

**Tools:** FastAPI, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, Triton Inference Server, Docker, Kubernetes, NGINX, OpenAI Evals/Governor analogs

### 7. üìà Monitoring
Track usage, cost, quality, and drift; retrain when needed.

**Key Tasks:**
- Continuous monitoring of latency, errors, & costs
- LLM-specific metrics: toxicity, hallucination rate, win-rate
- Feedback loops (RAG eval, human preferences), scheduled retraining

**Tools:** Langfuse, Helicone, Arize, LangSmith, Evidently AI, Prometheus/Grafana
